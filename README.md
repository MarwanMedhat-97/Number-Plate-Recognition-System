# Number-Plate-Recognition-System-
Automatic Number Plate Recognition System that detects the numbers of a car plate, removes the noise and all the disruptions and outputs the text of the car plate. It basically consists of 4 phases: - Acquisition of Vehicle Image and PreProcessing, Extraction of Number Plate Area, Character Segmentation and Character Recognition. This project will be used as a gate access controller. The gate grants access to vehicles with specific number plates to enter an organization’s premises. The gate will open if a number plate matches one of the specific number plates, otherwise, it won’t.
